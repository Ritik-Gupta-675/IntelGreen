# InteliGreen Models

## Overview
The Models component of InteliGreen contains TensorFlow-based machine learning models for satellite image analysis and deforestation detection.

## Model Architecture

1. **Core Models**
   - Forest Cover Classification
   - Change Detection
   - Deforestation Pattern Recognition

2. **Training Pipeline**
   - Data preprocessing
   - Feature extraction
   - Model training
   - Validation and testing

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Python 3.8+
   - TensorFlow 2.x
   - NumPy
   - OpenCV
   - GeoPandas
   - Scikit-learn

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Training Process

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Collect labeled satellite imagery
   - Preprocess images
   - Create training/validation splits

2. **Model Training**
   ```bash
   # Train forest cover classification model
   python train_forest_cover.py

   # Train change detection model
   python train_change_detection.py
   ```

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy metrics
   - Precision/Recall
   - F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix

## Model Deployment

1. **Model Export**
   - Export trained models to TensorFlow SavedModel format
